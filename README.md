# AuthPlz-UI

A frontend package for the [AuthPlz](https://github.com/ryankurte/authplz) User Management Microservice. This is intended to provide a base template for AuthPlz implementations.

Built using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

## Status

Early WIP. Not very useful at all.

## Dependencies

- [Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Make (but you could just run the commands from the [makefile](makefile) yourself)

## Getting started

1. Check out this repo
2. Run `make install` to install dependencies
3. Run `make build` to build the application
4. [Optionally] run `make minified` to build the minified application

## Usage

Run against an instance of authplz using `./authplz --static-dir=$(pwd)` (with the correct path to the authplz instance)

## Development
